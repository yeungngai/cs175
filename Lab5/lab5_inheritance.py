# Write your TransitionError class definition here.
# It is derived from the Exception base class, but has 3 unique properties that 
# need to be initialized in a custom __init__ method:
#   self.previousState - state at beginning of transition
#   self.nextState - attempted state at end of transition
#   self.msg - message explaining why specific transition is not allowed
#   HINT for __init__: look to see how this exception is raised
# It also has one unique behaviour (i.e. method): printMsg()
